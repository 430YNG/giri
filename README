Structure of the Code:
======================

The code is comprised of several components:

o lib/Utility: The utility library

This library contains utility code that is used by the other passes.  Of note
are the basic block numbering passes.  There is one pass which adds meta-data
to the code that gives each basic block a unique ID, one pass which other
passes use to query this information, and a final pass that removes the
numbering meta-data.

o lib/Giri: The dynamic slicing library

The name says it all; the Giri library implements dynamic slicing.
